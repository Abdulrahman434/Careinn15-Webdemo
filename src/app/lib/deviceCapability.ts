/**
 * Web-side mirror of the native DeviceCapability tier.

 * "Aggressive memory mode" enables the web app's own low-RAM adaptations
 * (smaller imageProxy cache, reduced carousel preloading). It must agree
 * with the native decision so the whole app behaves as one tier.
 *
 * Source of truth, in order:
 *   1. Native bridge  window.AndroidSystem.isAggressiveMemoryMode()
 *      — authoritative; uses ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice() + totalMem.
 *   2. navigator.deviceMemory  (Chromium: approx GB, coarse) < 3
 *   3. Unknown → false (performance-first) so we NEVER degrade UX on a
 *      device we could not classify. NOTHING changes on high-end devices.
 *
 * Computed once and cached — the RAM tier cannot change at runtime.
