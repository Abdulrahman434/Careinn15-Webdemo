/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Patient Preferences Form (source: Patient Preference Form V12)
 *
 * Replaces the old welcome slideshow in the onboarding consent step. Filled
 * within 24 hours of admission so patient preferences reach the care plan.
 *
 * LAYOUT — ONE QUESTION PER SCREEN, IN A CONTAINED DIALOG.
 * The form is a centred card on a dimmed backdrop, never a page: capped at
 * 760px wide and 88% of the height it is given, floored at 600px so it does
 * not resize under the patient between questions, and otherwise as tall as
 * the screen it is showing. Opened from the home screen it mounts inside the
 * kiosk's transformed 1920×1080 canvas (DESIGN_W / DESIGN_H in App.tsx), so
 * its share of the panel is the same however useScreenScale() scales it.
 *
 * Vertical budget, measured at 1920×1080:
 *
 *   header row                    ~62px
 *   progress block (shared)       ~191px
 *   question body                 ~346px on the ordinary screens
 *   footer (Back / Next)          ~97px
 *
 * The body scrolls rather than clips: at the design size nothing needs to
 * (the tallest screen is the English care-partner agreement at 886px, against
 * a 908px cap), but a panel shorter than the design canvas gives the card
 * proportionally less, so the cap binds there and the content has to stay
 * reachable.
 *
 * Arabic and Urdu run longer than English, so every size below is chosen for
 * the longest of the three, not for English. The tallest screen is the
 * care-partner agreement, then Q5, the doctors' rounds question: a wrapped
 * question over the wheel picker. Measure those, not a one-line English
 * question, before trusting a change to the budget.
 *
 * ANSWERS — two shapes. Most questions are yes/no with an optional note, and
 * the two timing questions (Q5 doctors' rounds, Q10 daily bath) are asked
 * open-ended and answered on the wheel time picker alone. Nothing on either
 * shape is answered in advance: no pill is highlighted and no time is
 * recorded until the patient taps or turns something — no pills, no note, the wheel on screen from
 * the moment the question is. Their answer is a time, so a yes/no over a note
 * would only ask the patient to write in words what the wheel records exactly.
 * The note is not a reveal either: on every yes/no question it is on screen
 * from the moment the question is, in a fixed place under the pills, so
 * tapping Yes or No changes the pills and nothing else. That makes the
 * note-open case the ONLY case to measure — there is no shorter variant of
 * those screens to fall back on.
 * "In advance" covers sittings as well as screens: the saved record is scoped
 * to the admission that wrote it, so a form filled in by an earlier stay — or
 * by a demo before the device reached the ward — opens blank rather than
 * pre-answered. See readPreferenceRecord().
 * The `choice` and `text` branches are still wired into renderControl but no
 * question reaches either — restoring one is a change to the question list
 * alone. `text` was last used by the favourite-colour question, removed from
 * the form; records written before that still carry its answer.
 *
 * TYPOGRAPHY — one hierarchy, one source. Section chip (TYPE_SCALE.base,
 * semibold) sits under the question (TYPE_SCALE.md, semibold), which sits
 * over the answer pills (TYPE_SCALE.base). Every question heading on every
 * screen reads its style from the single `questionHeading` object below;
 * nothing sets question type per screen, so no screen can drift from the
 * rest.
 *
 * The steps between those three are deliberately one scale notch each. A
 * questionnaire is not a poster: the reader already knows the big centred
 * line is the question, so rank is all the size difference has to carry, and
 * anything wider makes the short questions look shouted and the long ones
 * look like a wall.
 *
 * Question text is TYPE_SCALE.md (22px) at the 1920x1080 design scale, and
 * that is the floor for this screen rather than a starting point: patients
 * here are elderly or unwell, so anything under ~20px is not readable from a
 * bed. If a future translation stops fitting, cut words or let it wrap — do
 * not go under it.
 *
 * COLOUR — no hex literals anywhere. Every content icon is the per-hospital
 * PRIMARY on a theme.primarySubtle chip, so icons re-brand with the active
 * hospital and match the Next button, the progress bar and the step badge
 * rather than sitting on the secondary beside them. See iconColor below for
 * why the exact shade depends on light/dark mode. (The favourite-colour
 * question was the one exception, holding raw swatches as answer options; it
 * is gone, so the rule has no exceptions.)
 *
 * Sub-views are plain render functions, not nested components: a nested
 * component is a new type on every keystroke and the notes field would lose
 * focus after one character.
